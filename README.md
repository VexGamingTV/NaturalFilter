# NaturalFilter
My updated version of Neversinks poe2 lite filter.

Neversinks Base Lite Filter that this filter was based off of: https://github.com/NeverSinkDev/NeverSink-PoE2litefilter

Patch Notes for Version 0.3.0

#   1. Latest version takes the NeverSinkDev Lite Filter and changes colors to match in game colors from assets.
#   2. Color coded and added base types for each Jewel so you know which basetype dropped as soon as it drops. This includes the effects and Minimap colors.
#   3. I lowered sounds slightly so they arent so overbearingly loud.
#   4. Changed drop sounds on some items so not every drop sounds the same.
#   5. Fixed an issue in "Level 19 gems and up in maps get a special highlight" which would cause it not to get the special highlight.
#   6. Cyan was used a lot for drops making it hard to distinguish, we changed a lot of items colors.
#   7. Fixed an issue where Simulacrum Splinters and Breach Splinters had lower audio on drop when compared to other items.
#   8. Tweaked text size on many items.
#   9. Time-Lost Jewels basetype was added and the text size was significantly increased for these special jewels.
#   10. Added to the Currency Tier list and moved items around to better suit their value. (This will be the hardest section to keep up with as the game is so early and prices are very volatile)
#   11. Seperated Expedition Artifacts from other currency. (Own Color)
#   12. Seperated Omens from other currency. (Own Colors)
#   13. Instead of hiding gold I added them back as small little gold text for fun =)
#   14. Seperated Barya & Ultimatum from other currency. (Own Colors)
#   15. Seperated Tablet & Expedition Logbook from other currency. (Own Colors)
#   16. Added difficulty color border around the Waystones. 1 - 5 white, 6 - 10 Orange, 11+ Red.
#   17. I removed Flasks from the high level hidden list. If you want to hide flasks you can add #'s in front of show lines in new Flask section. (Read Note 21)
#   18. Added New section of Code called "Overrides - Popular Bases". All of the bases I know to be good is in this section and will show as a drop even in high tier maps.
#   19. Changed the Quality Items to only show when above 5% so its worth picking up as filler for Salvage
#   20. Level 20 Gems now make a divine sound effect when dropped.
#   21. After removing flasks from high level hidden list I realized that it needed to be cleaned up more so I made it to where Transcendent flask after area level 70 only show up if its superior. Otherwise you only see Ultimates.
#   22. Raised volume for high ticket overrides like Divines, Mirrors, etc to be significantly louder then the other sounds so you dont miss them.
#   23. Added Rares to the list of Good bases as seperate section incase I choose to edit the Background for just rare items. Also added a red border around all good base items.
#   24. Changed color for Essense, Distilled, and Catalyst.
